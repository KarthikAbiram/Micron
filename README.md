# Micron's Vision
- Enable easy exchange and swapping of microservices built with different programming languages easily.
- Create a docker compose type system for service executables, instead of containers.
- Provide tooling, libraries and batteries missing in default gRPC, like a client starting and stopping services.
- Reduce the barrier of entry in creating microservices in different programming languages.

# Languages
Currently supported languages: LabVIEW

## Other Supported Languages
Micron leverages and uses gRPC. So, any programming language supported by gRPC can be used - Python, C#, Go, Java, LabVIEW & more.

# Installation & Usage
