# Micron's Vision
The vision of micron is to allow users to create applications made up of microservices that can easily invoke and call each other. This allows you to leverage the best of different programming languages, without being constrainted to a single programming language.

Micron aims to provide tooling, libraries and batteries to reduce the barrier of entry in creating microservices in different programming languages.

# Languages
Currently supported languages: LabVIEW

## Other Supported Languages
Micron leverages and uses gRPC. So, any programming language supported by gRPC can be used - Python, C#, Go, Java, LabVIEW & more.

# Installation & Usage
